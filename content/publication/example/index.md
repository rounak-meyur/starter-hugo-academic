abstract: "Residential consumers have become active participants in the power
  distribution network after being equipped with residential EV charging
  provisions. This creates a challenge for the network operator tasked with
  dispatching electric power to the residential consumers through the existing
  distribution network infrastructure in a reliable manner. In this paper, we
  address the problem of scheduling residential EV charging for multiple
  consumers while maintaining network reliability. An additional challenge is
  the restricted exchange of information: where the consumers do not have access
  to network information and the network operator does not have access to
  consumer load parameters. We propose a distributed framework which generates
  an optimal EV charging schedule for individual residential consumers based on
  their preferences and iteratively updates it until the network reliability
  constraints set by the operator are satisfied. We validate the proposed
  approach for different EV adoption levels in a synthetically created digital
  twin of an actual power distribution network. The results demonstrate that the
  new approach can achieve a higher level of network reliability compared to the
  case where residential consumers charge EVs based solely on their individual
  preferences, thus providing a solution for the existing grid to keep up with
  increased adoption rates without significant investments in increasing grid
  capacity."
