I am a final year PhD student at the ECE Department of University of Virginia (UVA), Charlottesville. I am currently working as a research assistant at the NSSAC lab in the Biocomplexity Institute of UVA. I am also an endurance athlete and spend quite some time on my road bike.

My academic background is in Electrical Engineering with primary focus in Power Systems. My primary expertise lies in modeling of power system networks and analyzing impact of various events on the power grid. I have significant experience in using different convex optimization solvers.
